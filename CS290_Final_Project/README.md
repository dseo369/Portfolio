For this Web Development project, I worked with 3 other classmates to create a unique web-based social media site called TL;DR that
only allows users to post status updates, but are limited to 10 or fewer characters per post, including comments.
Our site runs on a node based server, and includes javascript to handle all user inputs and actions. 

The 4 of us collaborated on this project, but I contributed most to the front end development, including the making of our 
handlebars and stylesheet. While I did find that working on the server end of the site was challenging, I did enjoy learning how 
to use js in different ways, such as creating js functions and using node to build our server.

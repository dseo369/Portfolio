For this Usability Engineering project, students were split into groups to develop interactive prototypes via Figma, to showcase an application built 
using the UX/UI and heuristic principles we studied and researched over the course of the term. 

Here is a link to the actual Figma Prototype:

This slideshow shows my team's project "FoodFinder", which is a unique application that will help make food decisions easier for users by making food 
ordering/takeout fun and simple. This app allows users to choose a region of cuisine and then allows them to select a cuisine from that region by a 
swiping method similar to tinder. They are presented with a large image of the cuisine along with a delicious description about their cuisine to help 
make their choices easier. Some other functionalities of this app are being able to favorite recipes and cuisine regions, access more information on 
each cuisine, and recommendations based on history and similar ingredients. 

I wanted to include this in my Portfolio to showcase my ability to create prototypes for applications using proper UI/UX principles, as well as my 
ability to accurately improve upon initial designs based user feedback and ideas from teammates.

For this course (CS499 - Computer Graphics) we were tasked with creating renders of images based on the techniques we learned in class and papers, primarily from SIGGRAPH, based on research regarding rendering/synthesis techniques and applications.

In assignment 1, I utilized Blender to create ray traced results of different geometries of various materials. Luckily, Blender has a great renderer called Cycles that allows for better ray traced renders.
By using the Cycles renderer I was also able to produce some interesting/realistic shadows and caustics which reflected on the floor and walls behind the objects.

Assignment 2 covered a technique called Synthesis, which refers to the process of generating images by combining various elements such as geometry, textures, lighting, and shaders. This involves calculating the appearance of objects in a scene 
and how they interact with light to produce a final image. Synthesis techniques can range from simple rasterization to complex algorithms like ray tracing or global illumination, aiming to produce realistic or stylized images for visual representation.
I was able to use a technique called PatchMatch, a randomized correspondence algorithm for structural image editing, to synthesize extensions of an image based on key points, or patches, from the image.

For assignment 3, I used an image of a person and processed it through Blender to create a painted rendering of the original image. The technique I used to achieve these results is called Coherent Line Drawing, which focuses on emphasizing the essential 
shapes and contours of objects while reducing unnecessary details. This technique achieves coherence by emphasizing continuous lines and maintaining the structural integrity of the scene. It often involves algorithms that analyze the underlying geometry 
and lighting information to determine the placement and style of lines, resulting in images that convey a simplified yet coherent representation of the original scene. It is a technique that aims to create stylized images resembling hand-drawn sketches 
or ink illustrations, so it was perfect for this assignment.

This Web Development project asked us to create a website that displayed and handled inputs like a marketplace, and is called Benny's List.
I was tasked with building this site over the course of the school term, and I learned a lot about how to work on the front end development 
of a website using html and css. It isn't displayed in this project folder, but I also spent time learning how to create handlebars to make
the html building process easier. Finally, while I struggled with the server side code in the beginning, I attended many office hours with the
professor and TAs to really get a grasp on it, and I believe that is displayed in my server.js code.
